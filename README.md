# Git

Simple PHP wrapper for Git, forked from sebastianbergmann/git which is no longer maintained.

This wrapper is mostly focused on getting logs from a Git branch, for example to prepare changelog files from commits.

## Installation

You can add this library as a local, per-project dependency to your project using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

    composer require sebastian/git

If you only need this library during development, for instance to run your project's test suite, then you should add it as a development-time dependency:

    composer require --dev sebastian/git
